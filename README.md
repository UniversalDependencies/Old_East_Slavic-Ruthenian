# Introduction

The Ruthenian UD treebank includes texts written in "prosta mova" ("ruska mova", Old Belarusian, Old Ukrainian), a Western descendant of Old East Slavic spoken in the territories of modern Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Poland. A sample of legal and nonfiction texts written in ca. 1380-1650 is drawn from the Ruthenian Corpus, a historical language corpus resource currently being compiled by an independent research partnership.
